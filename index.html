            <p class="banner-discrition">Ever since childhood I wanted to do something with computers. When computers came to us, I used to spend time      playing computer games like everyone else.
                I have played many games in the computer world. After playing the game one day I thought how it was made. Then I searched the internet and found out a lot about making games. Since then the desire to learn coding awakened. From there he also wanted to know about computer coding.
